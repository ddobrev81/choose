# choose-mvc

Choose was a one of the first procedural php sites I've written. Then I got into Drupal so I totally left the MVC behind.
Currently I am trying to get into the popular PHP frameworks like Symfony. So I decided to refresh my MVC knowledge from
the past and rewrite Choose in a OOP-MVC way.

~~Here goes nothing.~~ Its done!

Obviously it is a single page site so the MVC components are really simple. Simple refactoring of the classes can accomodate more a complex site.

Next task on the menu is learning Symfony and rewriting Choose with Symfony.
