# choose-mvc

Choose was a one of the first procedural php sites I've done. Then I got into Drupal so I totally forgot it.
Currently I am trying to get into the popular PHP frameworks like Symfony. So I decided to refresh my MVC knowledge from
 the past and rewrite Choose in a OOP-MVC way.

Here goes nothing.
